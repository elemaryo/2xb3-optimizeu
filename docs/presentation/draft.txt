Slide 1: Introduction (Title Page)

Slide 2: Overview
	- Optimize path visitation of Uber drivers
	- Reduce wait times of passengers

Slide 3: Dataset
	- Manhattan, New York Uber pickups in 2014 (check if this is valid)
	(Also insert the source of the dataset: Kaggle?)
	- Rows consists of Date/Time, latitude & longitude
	- Over 500,000 pickups in a given month in the dataset (check validity)

Slide 4: Requirements:
	- Display a MST Graph of hotspot clusters consistently and accurately
	- Query processing should take lesser than 3 seconds 
	(A little uncertain on the time here, might be modified)

Slide 5: Algorithms
	- Search/Sort dataset by pickup time
	- K-Means Clustering of pickup hotspots
	- Kruskal's to generate MST of centroids for optimal path visitation

Slide 6: Visualization/Front-end
	- Users can select by time to see current hotspots
	- Java Graphics library generates cluster visualization with MST 

Slide 7: Verfication and Validation
	- White Box testing of Algorithms and ADTs
	- Black Box testing of Graph Output (This point doesnt make sense?)
